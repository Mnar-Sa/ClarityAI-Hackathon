## 🌟 Project Overview
**MindMap** is an AI-driven wellbeing platform specifically designed for teenage girls. It serves as an early distress signal detection system that bridges the gap between youth and mental health professionals using **IBM watsonx** technology.

## 🏗 System Architecture (MindMap Framework)
As shown in our **MindMap Architecture Diagram**, the system is built on a robust IBM ecosystem:

1. **Intake Agent:** Performs Sentiment & Emotion analysis on user input while extracting distress signals with a focus on privacy.
2. **Risk Scoring Engine:** Powered by **watsonx.ai**, this core engine analyzes emotional patterns and calculates real-time risk levels.
3. **Notification Agent:** Integrated via **watsonx Orchestrate** to automate the alert system for counselors and schools.
4. **Responsible AI Agents:** Managed by **watsonx.governance** to monitor bias, ensure explainability, and maintain ethical standards.
5. **Data Layer:** Utilizes **watsonx.data** for secure storage and governance-compliant data flow.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Early Distress Detection:** Identifying subtle emotional shifts before they escalate.
- **Explainable AI Insights:** Providing counselors with the "why" behind every risk score.
- **Privacy-Preserving:** Built with a "Responsible AI" first approach to protect youth identity.
- **Scalable Roadmap:** Future plans include Voice-based interactions and direct school integration.
